# PUBG: Black Budget ESP

In *Black Budget*, danger rarely runs toward you shouting. It waits behind walls, listens through doors, measures your footsteps. Survival is not only about aim—it is about *knowing*.

The **PUBG: Black Budget ESP** is a visual intelligence overlay designed to lift the fog just enough to let decisions breathe. Not blinding neon, not chaotic clutter—only quiet lines of information, drawn lightly over a hostile city.

This is awareness, not noise.

## 🧠 Overview

Crafted for **PUBG: Black Budget**, the ESP system renders real-time contextual data directly onto your screen. It does not interrupt flow; it moves with it, adapting to distance, threat, and perspective.

Guiding principles:

* Information before reaction
* Subtlety over spectacle
* Control in your hands

Whether you’re navigating interiors, scanning rooftops, or planning extraction routes, the overlay becomes a second sense—present, calm, optional.
